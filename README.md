## 🚀 Getting Started

### 🔁 Clone the Repository (Shallow Clone Recommended)

> The `.git` file is too large, so it's recommended to clone only the latest version with depth.

```bash
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/Mantissagithub/PHYDRA.git
cd PHYDRA
```

---

## 🐳 Backend Setup with Docker

### 1️⃣ Build the Docker Image

```bash
sudo docker build -t phydra .
```

### 2️⃣ Run the Backend Container

```bash
sudo docker run -d -p 8000:8000 --name phydra-backend phydra
```

🎯 Your backend is now live at: [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)

---

## 🛢️ Database Setup with Prisma (Python)

> Make sure your `MONGODB_URI` is set in the `.env` file.

### 1️⃣ Create the `.env` File

Navigate to the `prisma` directory and create a `.env` file with the following content:

```bash
cd prisma
nano .env
```

Add the following sample data to the `.env` file:

```env
MONGODB_URI=<your_mongob_uri>
```

### 2️⃣ Generate Prisma Client

```bash
prisma generate
```

🎉 Database schema is now synced and ready to go!

---

## 🌐 Frontend Setup

### 1️⃣ Navigate to Frontend

```bash
cd frontend/
```

### 2️⃣ Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3️⃣ Launch Dev Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

✨ Access the frontend at: [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173)
